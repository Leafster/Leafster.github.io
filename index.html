 <h2>
 What is IPOB?
 </h2>
 <p>
 IPOB OR Indigenous People(s) of Biafra is a group of sepratists from ___ aiming to seperate from Nigeria and be their own nation called Biafra. Despite being described as terrorists, they have not done anything inherently violent that counts as terrorism.
 </p>
 <h2>
 Why do they matter?
 </h2>
 
 <p>
 They matter simply because Nigeria (the place that they want to seperate from) is a dangerous and corrupt place, and they are trying to destroy that terrorism peacfully while they seperate. </p>
 
 <h2>
